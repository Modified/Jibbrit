The best way to learn a new language is to play with it: break the rules, make it fun, learn faster… Jibbr it!

# What's in here?

A quick & dirty (nu, [hackathon](http://www.hackathon.io/angelhack75)) modern web app developed during [AngelHack Tel Aviv](http://www.angelhack.com/event/angelhack-tel-aviv-spring-2014/) on 2014-06-20 at Google Campus TLV… by Alex, Sivan, Ron, and Ilan.

Buzzwords? Node (obviously), CoffeeScript, Zappa, responsive, OpenTok…

# Installation and stuff

Instructions… Nu. I think Google's *Web Starter Kit* had nice instructions for setting up Node and everything. Try that, and then the usual `git clone https://github.com/Modified/Jibbrit.git`, etc.
Run with `npm start` and browse to localhost:3000. Requires CoffeeScript in PATH. And, would actually want Nodemon instead, or some other watcher, to auto-reload/rebuild during development…

Oh, and you'd want to use [localtunnel](http://localtunnel.me/) so you can access localhost from multiple devices, with cameras, right?
